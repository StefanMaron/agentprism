"""Server → client push notifications when subagent sessions complete.

When a session spawned via ``agent_spawn`` finishes (the wrapped adapter
flips to a terminal ``done``/``error`` state), agentprism proactively pokes
the orchestrating MCP client so the LLM can wake up and process the
result without polling.

Two delivery channels, in preference order:

1. **``sampling/createMessage``** — the MCP server-to-client request that
   asks the client's LLM to run an inference. This is the ideal nudge:
   Claude Code (and other compliant clients) will surface the message
   into the active conversation. Requires the client to have advertised
   the ``sampling`` capability in its ``initialize`` handshake.

2. **``notifications/message``** — a plain log notification (level
   ``info``). Always available. Used as a fallback when the client did
   not advertise ``sampling``. Hooks / extensions on the client side can
   pick up the structured JSON payload to react to completions.

The ``MCPContextHolder`` is the bridge between the long-lived MCP
session (owned by ``server.run``) and the background asyncio tasks that
detect adapter completion. The lowlevel SDK only exposes the session via
a ``ContextVar`` set during request handling, so we capture it on the
first tool call and stash it on the holder for later out-of-band use.
